# Paul's Wyse 5070 - Gateway to home services via Tailscale
#
# A minimal thin client that provides access to home network services
# for devices on Paul's local network. His router points DNS at this
# machine, which resolves *.local to itself and proxies requests home.
#
# Network flow:
#   Device → DNS (*.local) → Wyse CoreDNS → Caddy → Tailscale → Home services
